# BPMN Extension
This repository describes BPMN extensions for business process modeling. BPMN element extensions and attribute extensions are supported by the implemented tools. Modelers can choose the suitable tool to model business processes according to BPM environment. In particular, we implemented a Web version and a local version.

## Local version implements BPMN extensions
We extend the modeling elements and attributes based on BPMN2.0. For typical Industrial Internet business requirements, we extend ten elements and three attributes. As shown in Figure 1, the red box represents element extensions and the purple box represents attribute extensions.

## Web version implements BPMN extensions
BPMN extensions implement the Web version, as shown in Figure 2.

## Evaluation for BPMN++ model and tools
To evaluate BPMN++ models and tools, we conducted a user experiment.Over a one-month period, we recruited 29 participants to model using BPMN++ and traditional BPMN.Finally, the user acceptance of the BPMN++ model and tool is evaluated via a questionnaire.

Table 1 shows the process model questionnaire, where A-E represents a score of 5-1. Score1 represents the score of BPMN model and Score2 represents the score of BPMN++ model.

Table 2 shows the modeling tool questionnaire, where A-E represents a score of 5-1. Score1 represents the score of BPMN tool and Score2 represents the score of BPMN++ tool.
