# BPMN Extension
This repository describes BPMN extensions for business process modeling. BPMN element extensions and attribute extensions are supported by the implemented tools. Modelers can choose the suitable tool to model business processes according to BPM environment. In particular, we implemented a Web version and a local version.

## Local version implements BPMN extensions
We extend the modeling elements and attributes based on BPMN2.0. For typical Industrial Internet business requirements, we extend ten elements and three attributes.As shown in below figure, the red box represents element extensions and the purple box represents attribute extensions.
